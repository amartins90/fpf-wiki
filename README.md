**TL;DR**
Read PDF files and retrieve useful information to update Wikipedia

This script written in Python read PDF files downloaded from "Federação Paulista de Futebol" [official website](https://www.futebolpaulista.com.br/Home/) containing match information as home team name, away team name, final score, attendance, venue, date and time.
All those data are saved into Python dictionaries and filtered to get the top ten highests attendances and, on the other hand, top ten lowest attendances.
Finally, the output is a text file formatted as Wikipedia style, ready to update championship' article.

Note: the assets are related to ["Paulista Sub-23 2ª Divisão Sicredi - 2024"](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campeonato_Paulista_de_Futebol_de_2024_-_Segunda_Divis%C3%A3o) championship.
