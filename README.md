Read PDF files and retrieve useful information to update Wikipedia

The code, written in Python, read PDF files downloaded from "Federação Paulista de Futebol" [official website](https://www.futebolpaulista.com.br/Home/) containing football matches information such as home team name, away team name, final score, attendance, venue, date and time, save those data into Python dictionaries and apply a filter to get the top ten highest attendances and the top ten lowest attendances. The output is a text file formatted as Wikipedia code, ready to update championship' article.
